    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We examine the extent to which participation in high school athletics has beneficial effects on future education, labor market, and health outcomes. Due to the absence of plausible instruments in observational data, we use recently developed methods that relate selection on observables with selection on unobservables to estimate bounds on the causal effect of athletics participation. We analyze these effects in the US separately for men and women using three different nationally representative longitudinal data sets that each link high school athletics participation with later-life outcomes. We do not find consistent evidence of individual benefits reported in many previous studiesâ€”once we have accounted for selection, high school athletes are no more likely to attend college, earn higher wages, or participate in the labor force. However, we do find that men (but not women) who participated in high school athletics are more likely to exercise regularly as adults. Nevertheless, athletes are no less likely to be obese. </p></div>

Athletic Admissions and SES Targeting</a> <br> with <a href="https://ahmedelfatmaoui.github.io/">Ahmed El Fatmaoui</a> <br> (updated August 14, 2025) <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This study investigates the extent to which U.S. universities strategically use athletic admissions to shape the socioeconomic status (SES) of their student bodies. Using a novel dataset linking NCAA roster data to neighborhood characteristics, we document substantial SES segregation across sports and universities. More selective institutions, particularly elite private universities, allocate up to 30% of enrollment to athletes who typically come from higher-SES backgrounds than their non-athlete peers. However, contrary to popular belief, we find that elite institutions enroll similarly wealthy athletes across all sports. Estimates of our structural model of sports bundle choice reveal that this SES homogeneity across sports limits universities' ability to systematically choose sports offerings to target higher-SES students. Counterfactual analyses demonstrate that athletic enrollment caps would create additional seats for non-athletes but require complementary policies to meaningfully impact socioeconomic mobility. </p></div><br>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We argue that increased consumption of vegetable seed oils high in omega-6 polyunsaturated fats has driven obesity in the United States, a link overlooked in the economics literature. Obesity rates have closely tracked the level of seed oils in the food supply since 1960, while diverging from calorie intake and exercise trends post-2000. We present evidence from biochemistry supporting this hypothesis, demonstrating how seed oils disrupt metabolism, fat storage, and other biochemical processes. We document supporting evidence of these mechanisms in economics research and population health trends. We then develop a conceptual theory of imperfect information to explain consumer overconsumption of these oils, considering the interactions among food and drug companies, scientists, government regulators, and medical providers in shaping dietary information and the overall food supply. Finally, we discuss policy implications, emphasizing the need for a coordinated approach. </p></div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </p></div><br>

    <p style="margin:0"> <b>The Role of Supply and Demand Factors in Explaining the Migration of College Majors</b> <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>  This paper documents a new stylized fact about the United States labor market: internal migration rates are dramatically different across college majors. For some college majors, migration rates are even lower than those without a college degree. I relate major migration rates with majors' spatial concentration and find that a major's spatial concentration explains about one fourth of the cross-major variation in migration rates. With this descriptive evidence as a guide, I estimate a structural model of locational choice where college graduates have heterogeneous preferences---at the detailed major level---for living close to home, and for working in a location with a high concentration of their fellow majors. Using estimates of the structural model, I decompose the cross-major migration rates into supply and demand factors and find that supply factors (i.e. moving costs) explain the vast majority of differences in migration rates across majors. My findings underscore the difficulty in attracting college majors to a particular location using demand-side investments. My results also highlight the importance of place in determining the labor market outcomes of college majors.</p></div><br>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This paper estimates the wage returns to schooling and actual early work experiences for young women using the NLSY surveys. We estimate a dynamic model of young womenâ€™s schooling, work, marriage and fertility decisions in order to account for the likely impacts on future wages. The results of the model without controlling for the decision process indicate a negative effect of children on earnings. Our full model explains how this occurs, demonstrating the importance of modeling these key life decisions, while controlling for unobserved ability.</p></div><br>

    <p style="margin:0"> <b>The Source of Athlete Admission Preferences:\\ A Structural Analysis of University Athletic Offerings</b> <br> with Ahmed El Fatmaoui. <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This study investigates the extent to which U.S. universities strategically use athletic admissions to shape their socioeconomic composition. Using a novel dataset linking NCAA roster data to high school characteristics, we document substantial socioeconomic segregation patterns across sports and universities. More selective institutions, particularly elite private universities, allocate upwards of 25\% of enrollment to athletes who typically come from higher-income backgrounds than the general student body. Estimates of our structural model of sports bundle choice reveal that universities offer specific sports as a pathway to enroll students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, effectively creating a mechanism for preferential admission of high-income students. Our estimates also show heterogeneity by NCAA division. Counterfactual analyses examine how athletic enrollment restrictions and modified Title IX requirements would reshape university athletic offerings, with implications for institutional diversity and access.</p></div><br>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We investigate how easing credit constraints affects college graduates' choices in majors and migration, focusing on the impact of student loan debt. Using a rich dataset combining university, credit bureau, and other records, we examine the effects of loan reduction or "No Loan" policies at select universities on students' major choices and migration decisions. By analyzing data across different dimensions, including parental financial constraints and socioeconomic networks, we aim to provide new insights into the relationship between education financing and upward economic mobility. </p></div><br>
